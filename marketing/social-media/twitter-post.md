## Main Thread Post

🐍 Built a Docker-free OCI image builder for Python projects

No Docker daemon. No Dockerfile. Just pure Python APIs.

Inspired by .NET—auto-detects Python version, deps & entrypoints.

Try it out & share feedback! 🚀

## Optional Follow-up Thread (if engagement is high)

**Tweet 2:**
Why? Because containerizing Python shouldn't require:
❌ Docker Desktop
❌ Writing Dockerfiles
❌ Understanding Docker-specific concepts

Just run: `pycontainer build --tag myapp:latest`

Done. OCI-compliant image ready.

**Tweet 3:**
Current features:
✅ Registry push (GHCR, ACR, Docker Hub)
✅ Smart base image selection
✅ Layer caching
✅ SBOM generation
✅ FastAPI/Flask/Django auto-detection
✅ Poetry & Hatch plugins

Check the README for details!

**Tweet 4:**
Looking for feedback on:
- Use cases that resonate
- Docker workflow pain points
- Features for production readiness

## Alternative Versions

### Version A (Technical Focus)
```
🐍 pycontainer-build: Native Python OCI image builder

Built images without Docker daemon using pure Python stdlib + OCI specs.

Auto-detects Python version from pyproject.toml, packages dependencies, creates multi-layer images.

#Python #Containers #DevOps
```

### Version B (Developer Experience Focus)
```
Tired of maintaining Dockerfiles for Python apps?

pycontainer-build does it all:
- Reads pyproject.toml
- Detects entry points
- Creates OCI images
- Pushes to registries

Zero Docker required 🚀

```

### Version C (Problem-Solution Focus)
```
Docker-in-Docker in CI is painful.
Dockerfiles are boilerplate.
Docker Desktop licensing is complex.

Solution: Build OCI images with pure Python.

No daemon. No Dockerfile. Just code.

## Posting Tips

**Character Limits:**
- Standard tweet: 280 characters (main post fits within this)
- Consider breaking into thread if adding more context

**Timing:**
- Best times: Weekdays 9-11 AM, 1-3 PM EST
- Tech audience peaks: Tuesday-Thursday mornings

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Reply to all mentions within 1 hour
- Retweet with comments for broader reach
- Use relevant hashtags but don't overdo it (3-5 max)

**Visual Enhancement:**
Add one of these:
- Screenshot of terminal output showing build command
- Side-by-side comparison: Dockerfile vs pycontainer command
- Short demo GIF (under 15 seconds, under 15MB)

**Tagging Strategy:**
Consider mentioning (only if genuinely relevant):
- @ThePSF (Python Software Foundation)
- Popular Python influencers
- Microsoft Azure / GitHub accounts (if officially affiliated)

**A/B Testing:**
- Post Version A on Day 1
- If low engagement, try Version B or C on Day 3-4
- Track clicks, replies, and retweets for each version

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- Primary: #Python #DevOps
- Secondary: #Containers #Docker #OpenSource
- Timing: Use during relevant Twitter Spaces or events
